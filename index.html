    <h3>Favorite Team Sport: Basketball</h3>
    <p>
        I love basketball because of the fast pace and strategic elements involved in the game. The continuous flow of
        offense and defense, along with the skills required to execute a play, make it an exciting sport to watch. The
        energy in the arena during a high-stakes game is truly palpable. With the ability to play both indoor and
        outdoor, it makes for a versatile and accessible sport for players of all ages and skill levels.

    <p>
        Basketball also has a rich history and cultural significance, with iconic players such as Michael Jordan and
        LeBron James who have had a profound impact on the sport and inspired countless young players to pick up a ball
        and start playing. The sport has also been a platform for <b>social justice activism</b>, with players using
        their platform and voice to bring attention to important issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, basketball is a <b>dynamic and thrilling</b> sport that combines physical athleticism, strategy, and
        teamwork, making it my favorite team sport.
